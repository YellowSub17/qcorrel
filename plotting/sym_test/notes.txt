Here are some better looking Qspace correlations that I'll include in the overleaf. These are now using a qmax of 0.37, the maximum in 1AL1. I have scaled the intensity by ^0.125 to better highlight some of the features, notably the winging we see in the jacks plots, which is seen in the r1r2 and the sumax0 plot. Another thing I have noticed in the sumax0 plots are the bands of 0 correlation at particular values of q. I can conceptualise how this would mean that out of the large list of correlation vectors, that there are just none that have that magnitude so nothing is correlated with it. Something to consider, if a protein doesn't scatter at a magnitude |q|, what does that imply?
