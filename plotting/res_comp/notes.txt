This series of pictures was used to used to determine why for different distances I was getting different PADF results. More specifically how changing the number of rbins changes the plots. Seems to me that the plots are similar enough. With a qmax of 0.3699, the middle nR value is using a rmin defined by the qmax (res = 1/(2*0.3699), rbins = rmax/res). THe higher res plots (higher nR) use a resultion that is about half that of the one defined by qmax ( res= 1/(2*0.6)).
I wanted todo a padf with res double that of the defined qmax, but the code would throw and error if the nR was too low. I tried a res of 1/(2*0.15), did work, so I settled for 1/(2*0.3) which is still less than the real qmax value. As far as I can tell, the differnce is noticible in the plots but you can still tell they are created by the same protien.
